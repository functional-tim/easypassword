-----------------------------------------------

This password generator was inspired by this comic of Randall Munroe: https://xkcd.com/936/.

It is cryptographically secure if the machine you are using it on is secure.

## How to use

```
easypassword [OPTIONS] seperator1 seperator2
```

To make the passwords more secure two seperators are choosen.

These seperators will alternate after every word. One seperator should be a special character and the other seperator should be a number. You can choose which one is which.

If you want to use your own word list file you can do so through the option `-i` or `--input`.
Each line of the file should be a single word or an open compound word.

```
easypassword -i file seperator1 seperator2
```
